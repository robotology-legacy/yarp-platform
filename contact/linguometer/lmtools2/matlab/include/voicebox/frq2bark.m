function b = frq2bark(f)
%FRQ2BARK  Convert Hertz to BARK frequency scale BARK=(FRQ)
%       bark = frq2bark(frq) converts a vector of frequencies (in Hz)
%       to the corresponding values on the BARK scale.

%   There are many published formulae approximating the Bark scale.
%   We use the one from Traunmuller.
