function [y,k]=maxfilt(x,f,n,d)
%MAXFILT find max of an exponentially weighted sliding window  [Y,K]=(X,F,N,D)
%
% Inputs:  X  Vector or matrix of input data
%          F  exponential forgetting factor in the range 0 (very forgetful) to 1 (no forgetting)
%             F=exp(-1/T)  gives a time constant of T samples
%          N  Length of sliding window [default = size(X,D)]
%          D  Dimension for work along [default = first non-singleton dimension]
%
% Outputs: Y  Output matrix - same size as X
%          K  Index array: Y=X(K)
%
% This routine calaulates y(p)=max(f^r*x(p-r), r=0:n-1) where x(r)=-inf for r<1 
% y=x(k) on output

% Example: find all peaks in x that are not exceeded within +-w samples
% w=4;m=100;x=rand(m,1);[y,k]=maxfilt(x,1,2*w+1);p=find(((1:m)-k)==w);plot(1:m,x,'-',p-w,x(p-w),'+')

% Bug: It would sometimes be useful to be able to specify initial values for x(r) for r<1
