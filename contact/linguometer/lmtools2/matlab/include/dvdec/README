What is it?

    dvdec consists of three matlab function, dvopen, dvread, and dvclose
    to enable the use of raw DV files within Matlab.

What are the prerequisites?

    You'll need the libdv library under Linux, which provides an API
    for parsing and decoding DV files.  It may work under Windows
    too, but I haven't tried it.

    And of course, you'll need Matlab and the mex build tools that
    come with it.

How do I build it?

    Type 'make'.  If your prereqs are satisfied, there will be no
    errors.

How do I use it?

    Add this directory to your Matlab path after building.  The three
    functions dvopen, dvread, and dvclose are now available.  For
    their usage, refer to the sample function playdv.m, which simply
    plays a DV file inside a Matlab figure.

What license does dvdec use?

    dvdec is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
