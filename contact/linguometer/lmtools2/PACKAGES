Title:    Documentation for lmtools2 .mat packages

Section A.1 - Introduction
--------------------------
The lmtools2 toolkit processes automatically the data recorded 
simultaneously with the Linguometer.
If you are reading this document, it probably means that you
dowloaded/obtained the .mat archives.

This document covers the format the data gets stored into 
the .mat files.
This document does not cover the process used to align and
segment the dataset.

Section A.2 - Compatibility
---------------------------
The author provides .mat files compatible with Matlab 7, 
since it is the only version available.
A short post about this topic has been posted here:

Section B.1 - Importing the files in Matlab 7
---------------------------------------------
You obtained the dataset somehow, and probably in a similar 
structure:

 exp_0001/
   dist_0000/
     wd_0000.mat
     wd_0001.mat
     wd_0002.mat
	 ...
   dist_0001/
   dist_0002/
   dist_0003/
   dist_0004/
   dist_0005/
   dist_0006/
   dist_0007/
   dist_0008/

Each "exp_EEEE" folder contains the processed data from experiment "EEEE".
Each "dist_SSSS" folder contains the processed data from sequence "SSSS",
experiment "EEEE".

I imagine that you want to load this file:
 exp_0001/dist_0000/wd_0000.mat

I usually do:
>> data = load('$ROOT/exp_0001/dist_0000/wd_0000.mat');

Let's give a look at "data":
>> data
data = 
      US: [1x1 struct]
      AG: [1x1 struct]
      LG: [1x1 struct]
      CC: [1x1 struct]
    misc: [1x1 struct]

Section B.2 - US structure
---------------------------------------------
Data from ultrasound system.
>> data.US
ans = 
    spc: [105014x1 double]
    fea: [105014x6 double]

data.US.spc		Main speech signal
data.US.fea		Tongue tracking features 
  				Right now is a big matrix of zeros.
				When the features extraction code will
				be ready, it will contain lots of numbers ;-)

Section B.3 - AG structure
---------------------------------------------
Data from articulograph.
>> data.AG
ans = 
    spc: [105014x1 double]
    amp: [105014x72 double]
    pos: [105014x72 double]

data.AG.spc		Secondary speech signal acquired via the main
				mic but down-sampled by the articulograph sw
data.AG.amp		Amplitude data
				The articulograph has got 12 recording sensors.
				6 reference coils induce 6 currents in each one
				of the 12 sensors.
				This structure contains the amplitudes of the 
				currents recorded.
				Let's imagine that:
				 cS_K
				means:
				 the amplitude of the current induced by reference coil
				 K in sensor S.
				Given that, here you have the column labels:
  				 c1_1 c1_2 c1_3 c1_4 c1_5 c1_6 c2_1 c2_2 c2_3.... c12_6
				In fact, 12 sensors x 6 currents = 72 columns
data.AG.pos		Kinesthetic data (no head motion compensation)
				For each sensor, the articulograph calculates:
				 x, y, z 		Cartesian coordinates
				 theta, phi 	Spherical coordinates azimuth and elevation
				 rms			Performance parameter
				The columns are:
				 x1 y1 z1 theta1 phi1 rms1 x2 y2 z2 theta2 phi2 rms2... rms12

Section B.4 - LG structure
---------------------------------------------
Stereo signal acquired via the laringograph
>> data.LG
ans = 
    egg: [105014x1 double]
    spc: [105014x1 double]

data.LG.spc		Secondary speech signal (LG mic)
data.LG.egg		Lx + Gx signal

Section B.5 - CC structure
---------------------------------------------
Data from camcorder.
>> data.CC
ans = 
    spc: [105014x1 double]
    fea: [105014x6 double]

data.CC.spc		Secondary speech signal (camcorder mic)
data.CC.fea		Tongue tracking features 
  				Right now is a big matrix of zeros.
				When the features extraction code will
				be ready, it will contain lots of numbers ;-)

Section B.6 - misc structure
---------------------------------------------
>> data.misc
ans = 
    time: [1x105014 double]
    rate: 48000
     xpr: 0
     seq: 0
     num: 0
     txt: 'mattone'
	
data.misc.time	Time axis starting from 0 seconds
data.misc.rate	Sampling rate of the signals
data.misc.xpr	Experiment number
data.misc.seq	Sequence number
data.misc.num	Word number
data.misc.txt	Submitted stimuli
