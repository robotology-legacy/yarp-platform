	\caption[LMTools2 diagram]{\textbf{LMTools2 diagram}: the \emph{LMTools2}
	toolkit operates on the dataset performing alignment and segmentation
	operations. It requires the user to compile a total of three configuration
	files, the rest of the processing is performed without the need of user
	interaction. The toolkit has been integrated using the knowledge of the
	workflow diagram, but adding new features is possible.
	The method proposed by the author produces a packaged version of the
	dataset and many informative logs and plots.}
