	\caption[Profile of the palate]
	{\textbf{Profile of the palate}: the profile of the palate has been recorded
	off-line by asking the subjects to keep water in their mouths.
	Furthermore, the subjects bent their necks of 45$^o$ over the sagittal
	plane.
	(a) A frame from the ultrasound system showing the acquired profile of the
	palate. (b) Hand-traced contours of the tongue dorsum and the 
	profile of the palate. Note: the tongue is not in the resting position.}
