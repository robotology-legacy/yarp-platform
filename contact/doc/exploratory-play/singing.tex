\section{Participation in rhythmic events}

As a component of exploratory play, we are interested in giving our
robot the ability to participate in patterned activity in real time
with a human partner.  We include in principle any form of
coordinated motor activity, including vocalization
(singing, proto-dialogue), and gesturing (tapping, dancing).
%
For example, if a human starts humming or tapping something rhythmic, 
we'd like the robot to rapidly join in.

Why is this useful?  Participation in rhythmic activity is a means to
an end, rather than a goal in itself.  The overall goal is to make
machine learning on our robots more autonomous.
%
Knowing the overall structure of an activity gives a ``skeleton'' upon
which the specific objects and actions (potentially initially
unmodeled) within that activity could be analysed.
%
Also, participating in activity is better than just observing it,
since there is an implicit signalling of ``comprehension'' level
available to the human partner, who can reasonably be expected to
adjust their behavior accordingly.


\subsection{Mechanism}

(see previous deliverable, d N.N)


\subsection{Implementation}

Work has now been applied in practice.
As a proof-of-co

 to a pitch
perception/production experiment.  We attached prediction to the
property of acoustic pitch.


- Apply across multiple signals

- Different aspects of speech sounds

- Arm movements, gesturing

- Exploit knowledge of structure for learning of parts


\subsection{Summary}

(spectrograms just show a low frequency range, to make the pitch visible).
